This is my implementation of the Bloom Filter for the dataset provided.
To install dependancies please run the command from a shell.
"python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
Place the Dataset in "./Data/" in the directory where the script is located.
Please run the program using the command
"python3 myscript.py"
The program first trains by filling a bit array and then evaluates on the test set as a data stream as per instructions.
The program then writes the outputs to a file Outputs.txt.
